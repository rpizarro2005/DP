# DP
# Data Products Final Project
# This app is a very simple one.
# Tha DATA is from R, the "spam" file
# Using a density plot the app let you see for each of 48 variables the graph for SPAM data and NOT SPAM data.
# So you can explore which variables (if any) are a good prospect to explain when a message is a SPAM one or not.
# Just it's exploration and just a simple application exercise.
